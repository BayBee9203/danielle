  <p>I am a participant in the First Nations Technology Council’s (FNTC) computer program called Foundations in Innovation and Technology program. FNTC partnered with the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology as well as the Nuu-Chah-Nulth Employment & Training Program to host us for the 12-week program. We have gotten the opportunity to learn so many great things!</p>

  <p>I am humbled for this opportunity to continue on my journey towards university. This is a great introductory program since we’re learning about so many technical topics.
