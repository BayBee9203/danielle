  <p>I really enjoyed this module in our course, I fully intend to continue learning on my own before heading off to university. I also really appreciate my classmates as well. Y'all have a very calming energy that my little soul appreciates.</p>

    <p>This is one of my most recent favourite songs. My boyfriend introduced me to this young artist whom passed away at a young age from an overdose.... I have his dicography, and find that his lyrics are quite relatable. But in particular this song I can relate to most.</p>
