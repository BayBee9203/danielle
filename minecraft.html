    <p>If you wanna know how to get to my heart: Minecraft! I started playing the game in 2012, and fell deeply in love with it. I took a break for a few years due to addictive playing.... There's been so many updates, and my laptop is outdated and not powerful enough to keep up, I don't play as often as I'd like to.</p>

    <p>The reason I got into Minecraft was mainly because I wanted to know why my brother played it so much. </p>
